# My Repository for the 2024 WPU Coding Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 WPU Coding Challenge, a year-long project where I aim to code something new every day. The challenge is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPwm_F9ljvg) by Web Programming Unpas, a web developer and educator.

The goal of the challenge is to improve my coding skills, learn new technologies, and have fun along the way. I will be using Javascript programming language and solving challenges on Codewars. Some challenges will be simple and small, while others will be more complex and ambitious.

## How to use this repository

You can browse the repository by folders, each one corresponding to a day of the challenge.

## Feedback and suggestions

I welcome any feedback and suggestions on how to improve my code, or ideas for new projects. You can contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Iyad_Rozan), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/iyad-rozan), or [email](mailto:iyadrozan26@gmail.com).

Thank you for checking out my repository, and I hope you enjoy following my coding journey!
